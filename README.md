📌 Project: Disaster Management & Emergency Alert System

🛑 Problem Statement:

Disasters and emergency incidents such as floods, fires, accidents, earthquakes, and hazardous situations require immediate reporting and coordinated response. However, in many real-world scenarios, communication between citizens, authorities, and responders is slow, fragmented, and lacks real-time visibility.Victims struggle to alert authorities quickly, responders do not receive accurate location-based information, and there is no unified platform to verify incidents, dispatch responders, track status, and broadcast public alerts.
This gap often leads to:
Delayed rescue operations
Miscommunication during emergency response
Poor situational awareness
Increased risk to human life and resources
This project aims to solve these challenges by developing a centralized, real-time Disaster Management & Emergency Alert System that enables instant reporting, structured verification, coordinated response, and safety awareness.

🎯 Project Objective

To build a MERN-based real-time emergency reporting and alert management platform that:
Allows citizens to report incidents with location, description, and media
Provides an SOS alert mechanism for critical emergencies
Notifies nearby users and authorities through push alerts
Enables authorities to verify incidents, assign responders, and track progress
Uses maps, geo-fencing, and alert zones for situational awareness
Maintains incident history and analytics for decision-making and preparedness

🧩 Core Modules to be Integrated

1️⃣ Real-Time Incident Reporting

Location-based incident reporting
Auto geo-tagging & timestamp
Media upload (image/video/audio)
